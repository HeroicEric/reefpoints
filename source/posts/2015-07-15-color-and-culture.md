*This post is based on a talk I will be presenting at [UX Camp](http://uxcamp.com/) July 18–20, 2015.*

Four posts in this series:
- [Part 1: Color use in art history](https://dockyard.com/blog/2015/06/25/color-1-art-history)
- **Part 2: Color in culture - understand your own assumptions** *(you’re reading it!)*
- *Part 3: A quick intro to color theory (coming soon)*
- *Part 4: A three-step approach to selecting color for UX design (coming soon)*

## A yellow and blue fence
![yellow and blue painted fence](https://i.imgur.com/MTiklTJ.jpg)

This is a cute fence that used to be painted blue and yellow and it was around a kindergarten building in Moscow, Russia early last year. But, the color of the fence almost caused the kindergarten to be shut down. Because, at about the same time, there was political turmoil between Russia and Ukraine and the fence colors just happened to be a cheery combination of blue and yellow that matched the Ukrainian flag. 

After the brief scare, the kindergarten was not shut down or burned to the ground, but instead, simply had to repaint the fence. 

This shows we can’t use colors without understanding their cultural context. Let’s look at some other curious examples of what colors could mean to audiences of differing cultures.

## Did Ancient Greeks care about color?

There are [dozens of references](http://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/20/science/homer-s-sea-wine-dark.html) to a “wine-dark sea” in the Iliad and the Odyssey. But did Homer actually mean that the sea was the same, deep red, color as wine?

Not necessarily. It is still a mystery to historians how exactly color was perceived in ancient Greece. My favorite explanation is that color, meaning hue, did not matter as much as how dark or light an object appeared. Another important quality was the surface: a shiny and a matte object that we might describe as the same color would not read as the same color quality in ancient Greece.

In fact, the color systems in Greek, Latin and various other languages and cultures do not convert neatly to our contemporary  R-O-Y-G-B-I-V spectrum of colors. As the most telling example of how different things can be, Umberto Eco uses the color system of the Hanunoo people. They described objects in terms of light and dark, but also fresh vs. dry and edible vs. inedible. 


## Color is poetry in Heian period Japan

Compared to Homer’s Greece, Japan, especially in the Heian period, is an opposite extreme. People at court really cared about colors. You could look at the arrangement of the layers of silk in someone’s sleeve, and you’d learn their social status, their sophistication, knowledge of the arts and their ability to poetically reflect the current season and mood through clothing.


## Language differences today
![blue vs blue in Russian google image search](https://i.imgur.com/hpXsHzO.jpg)

The lighter blue is called *голубой* and the darker blue is *синий*. They roughly correspond to sky blue and indigo - and actually are different colors in the rainbow, but the most commonly used and translated version is to simply call them both “blue”.

![Pink and red in Chinese](https://i.imgur.com/dIiqNWl.jpg)

A counter example in Chinese - the English differentiation between red and pink does not map directly to two separate words. Instead, the pink (粉红, *fěn hóng*) is a *powder red* or a modification of  red (红 or 紅, *hóng*).

## Pink aisle blue aisle

And actually - let’s look at pink for a bit. Where did this tradition of pink for girls and blue for boys come from? The concept of pink aisle and blue aisle is clearly a recent marketing construct, but why do we so easily assume that it just makes sense for girls’ things to be pink?

![Anthony Van Dyck painting with pink and blue](https://i.imgur.com/5xnNjIE.jpg)

In the 1600s and 1700s it was quite clear that a strong color like red - or its lighter version, pink, would be appropriate for a Flemish boy to grow up strong and masculine. A more subdued, softer shade of blue would clearly fit a girl better, because a 1700s woman was supposed to have a softer, quieter nature.

![Red states vs blue states](https://i.imgur.com/UIlbnl5.jpg)

Even the seemingly established red for Republican and  and blue for Democrat metaphor is quite new. Red and blue states used to switch each election season, and only in the year 2000 they somehow got stuck.

## How do you read a color?

### Green
![Islam, recycling, yes symbols collage](https://i.imgur.com/PaS1pum.jpg)

The color green is most often used to mean money. Because, well, one of the richest countries in the world happens to print money in this green color. The color of money in the US is actually related to an earlier Dutch reference: the cloth on bankers’ money counting tables used to be a deep emerald green. Regardless of the source - other countries with much more varied color currencies simply had to adjust to how the US read “green”.

In predominantly Muslim countries, a stronger cultural reference for the color green is the religion of Islam. 

When  we’re talking about natural things, or, say, sourcing materials - green stands for ecology and recycling. 

And finally, the meaning of green in user interfaces (when it is part of a system with red and yellow) is similar to a traffic light: green is “success”. 

Let’s keep going.

### Blue
![Mary and Krishna and accessible and hyperlink collage](https://i.imgur.com/FPsiodw.jpg)

The same blue can refer symbolically to Mary’s clothing (the “reserved” color of Ultramarine blue), or the skin of Krishna, and in modern days - to accessibility or web links.

### Red
![Communism and traditional bride and stop sign](https://i.imgur.com/Jdpj3uv.jpg)

Red is used consistently in traditional bridal-wear, in combination with gold. Politically, red often refers to Communism. In interfaces, the most common use of red is to show an error or a warning (like a stop sign) but I find that in Chinese interfaces, red has much less connection to “error” and is used more freely as an additional brand color.

### Yellow
![buddhist monks and alert message and school sign](https://i.imgur.com/Ib8Gxgp.jpg)

Just a few examples of “obvious” meanings of yellow: Buddhist monks, alert messages, a school bus, and sunshine.


## It’s a mess. Where do we go from here?

So we’ve seen examples of color meaning that contradict each other (which one to pick?) There are many more. We took time to look at them in order to become sufficiently scared of misunderstanding our users and then actually do our research. 

The formula is this: politics + cultural context + language differences + how important is color to the audience. This is how you know where to check for mistakes in selecting UI and brand colors. Always check your defaults and assumptions, and you’ll reduce the risk of a cultural #facepalm.

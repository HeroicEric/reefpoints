I’m super excited to attend (and help organize) this summer’s [UX Camp](http://uxeast.org/). Last fall we had an inspiring, productive weekend and this year I expect even more.

The camp is a project based weekend, meaning that in addition to talks and workshops, we can all bring a project we want to focus on. Today, I want to share what I tried last fall, how it turned out, and what I’m bringing with me this year.


## What I got last year

Last year, I focused on improving my visual thought process through quick sketching. I brought a clipboard, a felt tip marker and a stack of paper, and practiced quickly and roughly sketching out any ideas or notes that I wanted to capture throughout the event. My set-up (clipboard, paper and one pen) was intentionally minimal because I wanted to be able to pick up the project in the breaks between helping run and document the event, and listening to lectures and workshops.

The result was encouraging: I was able to fill about 25 sheets with rough drawings, and got a bit more comfortable capturing my ideas in drawing form, rather than as a list or a paragraph of text.

## What I’m doing this year

This year, I am hoping to try a slightly more involved project: repeat patterns. It will require a few extra tools, and a bit more space than last year’s.

**The inspiration**
I was inspired by Matisse - his paintings and even more, his creative process. He sourced colors and textures for his work from an extensive collection of textiles, artifacts and clothing. I want to create repeat patterns for use online ([an existing interest of mine](https://dockyard.com/blog/2014/07/23/repeat-patterns)) by sourcing color and texture inspiration from Matisse.

**The tools**
To sketch the patterns, I will bring:
- Markers in a few colors
- Sheer marker paper
- Masking tape (to display my results on a window)
- A ruler and a pencil
- Scissors and clear tape to re-combine shapes

**The process**
I plan to start with a grid and play with layering patterns on sheer paper to arrive at different solutions. The initial drawings will likely be very messy, but I  expect that the clarity will improve as I work on the same idea a few times. 

**The goal**
I plan to iterate in public so I can take advantage of the camp setting. While a specific result (pattern) may look good and useful to me, others may offer an unexpected opinion. By showing my work early and getting feedback - even if feedback is anecdotal, like - “*yeah, I might use something like that for a web project*” - I will have the advantage of many people’s perspectives.

So, here! I’ve shared my plans for camp! My colleagues at DockYard are getting ready as well. 

**Tim** is planning to either focus on a typeface he’s been crafting this year, or begin conceptualizing an idea for a live music website.

**Steve** is still undecided about what he’ll focus on in addition to running the camp. (Perhaps, you can [tweet an idea for him](https://twitter.com/uxeast) to work on!)

**Patrick** might finally tackle an infographic he’s been planning to make for [a pumpkin beer review site](http://bumpinpumpkinbeer.com/) he runs, so that he can release it in the fall.

**Amanda** will be working on a future conference talk and learning about animating SVGs.

What are you excited to work on? [Share your ideas](https://twitter.com/uxeast) with us!

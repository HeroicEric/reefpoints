I'm proud to announce the new [DockYard.com](http://dockyard.com)

![](http://i.imgur.com/D3KeY1b.jpg)

With this relaunch of our website we are also changing our direction as
a company. We've always been considered an *engineering* company but we
are now considering *ourselves* a **User Experience** company. All of
our design and engineering decisions go into delivering a modern user
experience for web application to our clients.

The new website is also built how we believe modern web applications
should be built: with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) on the front-end
and [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org) on the backend.

Over the next few weeks we're going to share the story on how to rebuilt
DockYard.com. You'll hear from our [Creative Director Steven Trevathan](http://twitter.com/strevat) on
what went into the Discovery of our new website, the design decisions
made, as well as a view of some early mockups and how we came to the
final design. [Dan McClain](http://twitter.com/_danmcclain), our head of our Engineering team will discuss
how we built the Ember application the "DockYard Way" which meant we
actually had to make contributions back to Ember itself, as well as
several other libraries, in order to get the experience just right.
[Amanda Cheung](http://twitter.com/acacheung), our Lead UX Developer, will share what efforts went into the implementation of
the design, how we build modern response markup. Finally you'll hear
from [Jon Lacks](http://twitter.com/jon_lacks), our Project Manager, will show how we managed the rebuild
of our own website using the exact same processes we use on our client
projects.

Along with these stories we'll not just tell you how we did things, we
plan to show you. We'll be open sourcing all of the code for the Ember
front and as well as the Phoenix back end in the coming weeks. There are
also many libraries that we plan to extract from the application to
share with everyone.

I'm extremely proud of the team for delivering this rebuild. It is the
best example of the quality and integrity of our design and technical
capabilities to date.

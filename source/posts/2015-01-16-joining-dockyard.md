summary: "Reflections on the past few months of being employed at
DockYard"
---

Six months ago from today was when I officially signed the
letter accepting the offer to join DockYard as a Senior Developer. It
was the best decision I could have made.

Switching companies can often bring a mixed bag of emotions. As exciting
as the new opportunity may be, the excitement tends to also be sprinkled
by anxiety of the new and unknown.

When I announced my resignation to my previous employer, he said that if
they had known a year before that choosing Ember as our new application
framework would eventually make me want to pursue a new Ember-focused opportunity,
they would have gone with Angular.

I first started dipping my toe in Ember in late spring 2013, some time after
Ember 1.0 RC3 was released. The Ember.js community was undeniably very active and
vibrant. That following June, I attended my first Boston Ember meetup,
where [Dan Gebhardt](https://twitter.com/dgeb) shared tips on testing Ember apps
and [Alex Navasardyan](https://twitter.com/twokul) gave an introduction to Ember Data.
That's how I came to know of DockYard.

Soon, some names started to emerge as familiar names within the
community. [Brian Cardarella](https://twitter.com/bcardarella) became
known within our dev team as the one who wrote
[ember-validations](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-validations),
which we were using in our application. [Robert
Jackson](https://twitter.com/rwjblue) was another name that kept popping
up on my Twitter and GitHub feeds. Call me a nerd if you will, but I was
as excited to have The Robert Jackson accept a fix that I submitted to
[ember-dev](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-dev) to make builds pass on
Windows (with Rake at the time) as I would be meeting a celebrity.

DockYard reinforced its reputation by organizing the Wicked Good Ember
conference in Boston in June of 2014, which I of course attended.

Needless to say, when Brian reached out to me last July about joining the team, I
saw it as an opportunity that was really hard to pass on. Logistically,
I may have been better off staying where I was. I had a 40 min commute.
Joining DockYard would have doubled my commuting time. I was also
comfortable with the position I was holding, building out cool D3.js
charts with Ember, leading the development of new products, and getting
myself involved in all kinds of engineering team growth efforts. But
then there was DockYard. I went with my gut feel instead and left
the comfortable seat to face the exciting, though new and scary that was
DockYard.

Scary? Yes. From everything DockYard had done to the Boston community
and the talent behind its wheel, I was absolutely terrified of not
fitting in, that it was too elite for me. I checked out the team page on
the DockYard website and read everyone's biography a number of times,
trying to picture what kind of co-workers I would be interacting with
daily. No matter how great the projects can be, culture is a big thing.
I'm thrilled to say that the one at DockYard is the one that resonates the
most with me in my 10 years of professional career.

DockYard has a well-balanced team of young, bright minds and more
seasoned developers, and I embrace that. There is none of that "I am
better than you" bullshit; those I once viewed as Ember gods and would
have been intimidated to talk to are as supportive and encouraging as one
can be. In the past, having been involved in the hiring process for
Engineering, I've always wondered where all the great developers were.
Well, they're here, happily employed at places like DockYard. If there
is one thing I can say about the company, it's that it's doing something
right to attract an amazingly talented and diverse crew. I've been
particularly impressed with our designers. It's nice as a developer to
work on such nifty UIs!

Doing consultancy work is new to me, and I've been warned about what I was
throwing myself into, that I'd end up losing focus on quality and just
hack solutions together quickly to meet client deadlines. I don't doubt
that those kinds of situations can creep up, but so far, I've found
quite the opposite at DockYard in the two projects that I've been
involved in. People care deeply about their work and hold high accountability
for what they deliver, aiming for the best of what they can achieve.

It's also refreshing to be able to work on something new and different.
The first few months of joining DockYard, I worked on an Rails and Ember app
that incorporated some really cool geolocation functionality. The next
project is one that is unlike any other app I have ever developed and includes
Arduino code, Ember.js, Node WebKit (NW.js), and working with web
sockets.

And the best, of course, is DockYard's mindset on open source. I always
look forward to our "DockYard days" on Fridays to hack on code, blog
(this is my first one!), contribute back to the community in some ways,
or just to level up our craftmanship.

And as much as everyone works really hard, we also know when to have
fun, be it through Risk game tournaments, friendly games of Carcassonne
(or, as some would say, "Casserole"), or world exploring and building on
Minecraft.

Finding a job that you'll love can be hard. Finding a team that you'll
love working with can be even twice that hard. And sometimes, it's okay
to leave behind what you feel is comfortable and secure in light of
something promising yet unknown. You may be pleasantly surprised.

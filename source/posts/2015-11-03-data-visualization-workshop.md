I’m very excited to host UX East's next workshop on [data visualization](http://www.meetup.com/UX-East/events/226344211/) here at DockYard! I received my Master’s degree earlier this year from Northeastern’s [Information Design and Visualization](http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/artdesign/academic-programs/mfa-in-information-design-and-visualization/) program, and data visualization is one of my favorite things to geek out about. 

There are many interesting parallels between UX design thinking and the process around creating data visualizations. This workshop will be a comprehensive overview of that process, with a special focus on context and experience. Together, we’ll explore a dataset (a very interesting one!), create a story around a target audience, use the data to define appropriate visualization methods, and storyboard the experience.

Creatives and makers of all types and skill levels are encouraged to come. During this workshop, we’ll manually look through the data and sketch our explorations. No background in engineering or design is needed, but we can  discuss digital visualization tools for those who are interested. It’ll be a very fun collaborative evening. 

To give you a taste of some of the examples to come - here are a few of my favorite data visualizations that create very different experiences. Many more will be included in the pre-workshop presentation about data visualization basics and best practices.

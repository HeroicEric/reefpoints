I'm very happy to announce that [Chris McCord](http://twitter.com/chris_mccord), the creator of the 
[Phoenix Framework](http://phoenixframework.org/), has joined the DockYard team!

We've been working with Phoenix for nearly a year now. We love it. So
much so that we dumped Ruby on Rails and doubled down on Phoenix and
Elixir as the future. With Chris joining our team we hope to invest
heavily in that future.

Chris' primary responsibility at DockYard is to continue building Phoenix
and make it the best choice for backend frameworks. He will be available
for consulting through DockYard in limited capacity but his knowledge is
already making its way through our team.

[If you have a project in Phoenix we'd love to
chat.](http://dockyard.com/contact)

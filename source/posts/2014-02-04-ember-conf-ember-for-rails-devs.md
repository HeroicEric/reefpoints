We invite you to learn from DockYard for a day before [Ember Conf](http://emberconf.com) in Portland, Oregon. We will be offering a one day training session for Ruby on Rails developers interested in
learning how to build Ember Applications. Over the course of the day we
will teach you the following:

#### Introduction to Higher Level JavaScript Concepts

* ES6 Modules
* Promises

#### Introduction to Ember Concepts

* Client side MVC

* All the stuff under the hood of Router, Routes, Models, Controllers,
  Components, Templates, and the Runloop

Together we wil build two applications before the day is over. The first

a more advanced desktop-quality style applicaiton.

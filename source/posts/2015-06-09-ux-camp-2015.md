Let’s go back to camp.

This July 18-20 we’re heading back up to Maine, and to a really cool (remote) location. We have four cabins on the lake in Caratunk, ME, and I invite you to join us!

Just like last year, it’s a UX design focused project weekend with intermittent design talks, workshops, games, and music. This year we’re going to have the incredible (Boston based) band [The Grownup Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6ytkBYaIU4) performing for us around the camp fire.

And for those of you who are musicians, I implore you to bring some instruments. There will be musical improvisation, led by The Grownup Noise, and we’d love for you to play along with us.

If you have questions or are interested in sponsorship, please e-mail me at [steven@dockyard.com](mailTo:steven@dockyard.com).

See you there!

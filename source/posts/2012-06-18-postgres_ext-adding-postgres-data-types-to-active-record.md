Over the past few weeks, I have been working on a new gem which adds
support to Rail's ActiveRecord for PostgreSQL's native data types. I am
happy to announce that I have released the
[postgres\_ext](https://github.com/dockyard/postgres_ext) gem.

postgres\_ext supports for ActiveRecord version 3.2 and above (at this
time). Parallel to my development, I plan to submit pull request to
Rails master, so that postgres\_ext will not be needed in Rails 4.0.

## Features

### Migration/Schema support

postgres\_ext adds migration and `schema.rb` support for the following
PostgresSQL type:

 * INET
 * CIDR
 * MACADDR
 * UUID
 * Arrays

You can create columns with the following migration methods:

```ruby
create_table :examples do |t|
  t.inet :ip_address
  # INET Column

  t.cidr :subnet
  # CIDR Column

  t.macaddr :mac_address
  # MACADDR Column

  t.uuid :unique_id
  # UUID Column

  t.integer :int_array, :array => true
  # Integer[] Column
end
```

These migrations will be captured in your `schema.rb` file, so you don't
have to use the `structure.sql` file if these types are your only reason. In
fact, if you are using these only supported types with `structure.sql`,
including the postgres\_ext gem should allow you to correctly `rake
db:schema:dump` your database.

### Type Casting

postgres\_ext converts INET and CIDR values to
[IPAddr](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/ipaddr/rdoc/IPAddr.html) instances,
 and coverts arrays to array objects of the column type (integer arrays
are cast as an array of integers, INET arrays to are cast to an array of
IPAddrs).

### INET Type Casting example

```ruby
create_table :inet_examples do |t|
  t.inet :ip_address
end

class InetExample < ActiveRecord::Base
end

inetExample = InetExample.new
inetExample.ip_address = '127.0.0.0/24'
inetExample.ip_address
# => #<IPAddr: IPv4:127.0.0.0/255.255.255.0>
inetExample.save

inet_2 = InetExample.first
inet_2.ip_address
# => #<IPAddr: IPv4:127.0.0.0/255.255.255.0>
```

### Array Type Casting example

```ruby
create_table :people do |t|
  t.integer :favorite_numbers, :array => true
end

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
end

person = Person.new
person.favorite_numbers = [1,2,3]
person.favorite_numbers
# => [1,2,3]
person.save

person_2 = Person.first
person_2.favoite_numbers
# => [1,2,3]
person_2.favoite_numbers.first.class
# => Fixnum
```

## Another gem born out of necessity

I have also released
[pg\_array\_parser](https://github.com/dockyard/pg_array_parser), a C
extension which parses PostgreSQL array values and returns an array of
strings.  This gem is used by postgres\_ext to retrieve the array values
before casting them to the required type.

## Plans for postgres\_ext

[INET, CIDR and MACADDR support has already been added to Rails 4.](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/ruby/2012/05/18/rails-4-sneak-peek-expanded-activerecord-support-for-postgresql-datatype.html)
My next step is to submit a pull request to add UUID migration support
and Array support to Rails master.  Then I plan to backport Rails 4's
hstore support back to postgres\_ext. After adding support for the other
PostgreSQL types, I plan to add support to arel for PostgreSQL type
specific where clauses (ie ANY for array comparison, `<<` and `>>` for
INET and CIDR comparisons.

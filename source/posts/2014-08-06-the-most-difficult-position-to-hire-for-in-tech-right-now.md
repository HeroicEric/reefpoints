The most difficult position to hire for in tech right now is not
engineering. It isn't design. It is the hybrid position: the UX
developer. Or the UX designer. Or the implementation developer. Or the
CSS engineer.

This is how difficult it is, I have no idea what the "official" title of
this position is. We seem to go back and forth every few weeks on what
to call it. But, this role has become incredibly crucial to how we and
most web companies operate.

Historically the responsibility for this position has fallen to
engineering, or maybe design, depending upon how your team ran things.
And it was the worst work. Cutting HTML, building terrible CSS. But
today process and standards have fallen into place to make this role a
legitimate one that people should build a career in.

Understanding how to optimize pages rendering, reduce CSS selector
lookups, organizing stylesheets and markup files. This is just the
start. Finding someone that can communicate between design and
engineering is a challenge and the people I've found to naturally fit
into this role excel at this. All of this before we ever start to talk
about accessibility, browser compatibility, standards compliance, and
responsive design.

However, there is barely anyone out there making a career in this role.
Perhaps because it has been traditionally looked down upon. Or perhaps
because engineering and design get the glory. The UX developer might
think of one's self as the red-headed-stepchild.

We've taken a lot of efforts to bring the same quality we have in
engineering and design here to our HTML & CSS. We've adopted
[BEM](http://bem.info/),
[SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), and we're constantly looking to improve
our process and the tools we use. Have other companies found similar issues with this
growing field? I'd like to hear from some people.

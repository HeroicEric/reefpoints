*The Doldrums* is a sailing term. It means when you're stuck on the
water with no wind. Your only option is to wait for the wind to pick up
so you can continue on your way.

DockYard is currently in the doldrums.

Maybe this isn't something that a consultancy should publicly admit,
but we've seen client engagement significantly dry up for us in the past
month and a half. Where we were selling and turning clients away a few
months ago, we are struggling to close a single deal right now. This is
the ebb and flow of consulting, it happens. Our only option is to wait
for the wind to pick up so we can continue on our way.

I was speaking with a few other software (Ember) consultancies recently
and they voiced similar stories. I am not certain why Ember has seen
such a steep drop off in interest. One theory is that Ember is currently
in the *Trough of Sorrow*

Does a framework follow similar trends to a startup? Perhaps. In any
event, we're now trying to diversify our offerings. I announced last
week that DockYard is now offering Staff Augmentation services. This has
piqued some interest but we're seeing a lot of inquiries for starting a
few months from now.

It is funny because I know in a month or two we'll be fine. We just have
to survive the thin times, which is always stressful. How we weather
this will speak a lot about DockYard as a company. It is said the only
way to survive the *Trough of Sorrow* is going to be company culture. If
this is true then I'm quite confident in us.

I also realize that we're towards the end of a financial quarter.
Companies tend to reach out after the start of a quarter, but if I were
them I wouldn't wait. If companies were to [contact
us](https://dockyard.com/contact) now they would find us in a position that
would be easy to negotiate with.

I'd be interested in hearing from other shops: have you experienced The
Doldrums? What pulled you through? What strategies have you put in place
to avoid them in the future?

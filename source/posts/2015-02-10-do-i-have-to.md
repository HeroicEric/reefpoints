##Why is it hard?

I understood how important it is to manage a conversation when I first interviewed someone to fill the position I was leaving. Being on the other side of the table gave me a new appreciation of asking just the right questions. (It seemed that I was just there yesterday as an applicant myself!)

So why is it so damn difficult and awkward? I think the reason is that we have very little context for the kind of conversation an interview requires in our everyday life. A user interview is heavily managed by the person asking the questions. It is an unfamiliar thing to do because we’re used to conversations in which both parties share control over the direction and tone.

So, conducting a user interview or a user testing session can be pretty stressful in the beginning - right up there with having your first job interview. We want to share our learning experience, and help make the process a bit less weird for everyone else starting out.

##We still have to do it.

For our work in UX design, finding information through user testing and interviews is a core skill. Many designers, like me, may be transitioning from a more craft-focused practice to a role that includes more strategy. Interviewing is here to stay, and we all better get good at it.

##The secret sauce

###Before we begin:

Since interviews and user tests are heavily managed, they take a lot of preparation. At this point, we knew roughly what questions we need answered - what type of information we needed to discover. Here are the things we did next:

- We scheduled time to meet with users. The client may help by putting you in touch with some preselected users to interview.
- Arranged for the legal details. This could include notifying the interviewee of privacy arrangements, having them sign an NDA, or otherwise vetting the situation. Basically, you want to protect yourself, the person you’re interviewing, and the client by being very clear how information is going to be used.
- Drafted a sequence of questions that cover our desired information. 
- Edited until questions sounded polished and neutral (more on this in a separate post)
- Grabbed a notebook, pen and a laptop.
- Printed our questions so we can write notes in between and check things off
- Prepared backups and extra copies of any materials we’re planning to use.
- Brought water and a snack! You don’t want to take focus away from the interview by being too thirsty or hungry.
- Grabbed a timer and a sound recorder (your needs may vary)
- Triple-checked our list of interviewees and their basic information. For example, phone interviews can happen over different time zones and it’s nice verify you're not calling the person who kindly offered up their time at 6am. 

###Practice makes a difference
We were surprised to see how much we were able to refine our strategy each time we completed an interview. After two or three, we had a much better understanding of the type of  information we needed to find out, and what questions yielded the best responses.

###Going with the flow
With each interview, we gained flexibility in how we asked questions. Asking one thing may lead naturally to another, and rather than stopping the user and refocusing the interview to match our prepared list, we jumped around to whatever questions seemed natural to address next. Knowing the questions well after a few interviews helped us do that comfortably.

###Teamwork
It definitely helped to have a team of two handling the interview. This way, one person asks questions, while the other focuses on capturing notes, including nonverbal cues like body language, expression, and movement (especially important with a physical interface we were using). A very experienced interviewer could probably handle both tasks with grace, but in the beginning it’s almost impossible. Trying to do both would either result in awkward pauses as you frantically try to scribble down the notes, or in failing to record some valuable details. Nonverbal details are especially vulnerable in a rushed situation - you couldn’t transcribe that stuff from a voice recording later.

###Clarity over the phone
For another recent project, we used phone interviews to gather data. The challenge with only speaking on the phone is that we lose most of the added information of body language and facial expression, so had to make up for it with extra questions. We had to test our assumptions (e.g. “I’m guessing you’re looking at the laptop screen for reference - is that correct?”) and to and to be extra attentive to the tone of voice to gauge emotion, like  hesitation.

Another possible challenge in phone interviews is the quality of the sound you get. Users may be on a shaky cell phone connection, or calling us via Skype. This can make their (and potentially your own) voice difficult to understand. It was often tempting to dismiss the poor quality of sound and just omit details we couldn’t quite hear, but we made sure to always ask the interviewee to repeat or speak louder when we did not understand what was being said.


###Establishing context

It is always a good idea, even if your interviewee should theoretically know who you are and what you’re talking about, to remind them about it, and confirm your assumptions about their background. This introduction can be brief, but will save you a potential embarrassment later in case you start the interview with incorrect assumptions. For example, you could start with “Hi, ____ thank you for taking time to do this! My name is _______, and my company was hired by _____ to improve their product. How familiar are you with the product?”

###Directing the conversation

For a UX designer starting out, it may seem rude to redirect the conversation, especially if your interviewee is describing, with passion and detail, a subject they are an expert in. Do not be afraid to redirect the conversation. You need to get to the specific questions you wanted answered (but of course be nice about it!). 


##Getting over ourselves

Conducting interviews caused us to cringe quite a few times. Looking back, I can see how we got over our fears, and improved with practice.
 
Remember, both you and the interviewee are there because you want to improve some aspect of people’s lives through your work and their experience. You’re on the same side, and you share this interest in the thing you’re discussing. Make the most of this interviewing situation, and you will see improved results each time.

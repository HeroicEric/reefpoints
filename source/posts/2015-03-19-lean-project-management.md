The core idea of Lean is to maximize value while minimizing waste. When it comes to running projects in a Lean way, this goes far beyond the role of the Project Manager (or Scrum-master) thus requiring the right recipe of team, process, work environment and pride.  

The Raw Materials -

 If any of these seem unreasonable, you need to take a hard look at your team and work environment -

* A team well-balanced in terms of seniority - Experience is contagious !
* Dedicated team members not split across multiple projects
* Co-location of team members is most ideal
* Use of Information Radiators — Physical views into plans (e.g. Post-Its on a whiteboards) that may supplement a digital plan view
* Team members willing to be transparent about blockages and issues they face (but also think of creative ways to solve problems)
* Conduct retrospectives with vocal contributors that embrace continuous improvement not only at the individual capability level (but at a team level)
* Smaller teams (no more 5-7) —  Once you breach this team size communication complexity increases exponentially.  Frederick Brooks does a wonderful job explaining this phenomena in his book “Mythical Man Month”
* A knowledge management strategy ensure team members know where to store/post directional artifacts that other team members require to do their job (e.g. Wireframes, PSGs, Test Cases, Context Diagrams )
* Conduct Retrospectives

1.) Breakdown the work -
Decomposition of capabilities/features is a necessary (and somewhat painfull) evil.  However, you do not need to go to painful level of detail to create this artifact.  The importance is breadth not necessarily depth.  The depth only needs to go as far as necessary for the team to directionally understand where a feature needs to go.  A good test of this is that a team member is able to provide some form of time estimate (Best and worst case) for one of those lower level items.  Get the full team involved, apply the 80/20 rule and time-box the activity.  

2.) Define a Path -
Once you know the work - work with the team to come up with a logical chronological execution of the work driven by value and risk/complexity of a given feature.  Front loading your risk/complexity is very acceptable and smart approach because impact of course correction early on is much less invasive.   Ensure basic architecture for the solution is derived and communicated. This ensures that the team has a solid foundation to build upon.

3.) Respect the Pyramid of Constraints
Scope, Time and Cost —  Fundamental variables applicable to any project context.  Visibility and active monitoring of these variables is essential to ensure project success.  First and foremost, ensure that a baseline is established for each of these variables before a team even start the project. Understand how your stakeholders rate the relative importance of each of these variables and uphold the fact that trade-offs are the only way these baselines can/will adjust.   Deferring this activity to after a project gets going can result in scope creep and cost/time over runs.  

4.) Hold up the mirror -
As a PM, it’s your responsibility to hold up a mirror in front of your team that shows the good, the bad and the ugly.  This allows the team maintain appreciation for the big picture while they do their best to work through the small one.   I am huge advocate of a plan view that I have blogged about in the past ( The "High level plan") — It shows time, features, tasks, distribution of work across team capability areas (Design, Backend, UXD, etc.) progress made, unplanned work and deffered work that will come in later releases.  If you have this and revisit it often- consider your team informed and that those Triangle of Constraint variables are being monitored (for the most part.)

5.) Create an environment of ownership and accountability -
Everyone is a player. PM’s should be servant leaders, therefore any plan created needs to be the teams plan not he PM’s (or Sr. Mgmt Plan.)  This way the team has accountability and ownership rights over what ever happens to the plan.  If something is not going as planned team can understand the implications of this and course correct and work to reveal why something my not be working out.  Constant readjustment and calibration is required to keep things moving along.

No team member can slip into the shadows. To be successful every contributor needs to have a voice.  A PMs need to put their “Facilitation” hats on and ensure they proactvily encourage all to participate and chime in on team affairs… That’s the beauty of teams - they succeed together not as single entities.  

6.) Demonstrate Progress -
The power of demonstration (enabled by time-boxed iterations/sprints,) whether it is for the client or kept internal to the team, results in extended benefits.  Demonstrations reground the team in terms necessity to make progress vs. spin wheels.  Demos encourge quality, because no one wants to demo something that does not work (or look good.) Stakeholders  can rest assured they did not buy snake oil and value is being delivered.  Demonstrations ensure your heading in the right direction.  Allows the team to celebrate success in short bursts - It feels great to get something done especially when the road ahead is a long one !

Give it a go and let me know if this works for your team.

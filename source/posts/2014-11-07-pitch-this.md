Here is something I probably shouldn't be admitting: I can't put
together a sales pitch for my own company.

It's not that I don't know what we do, I am intimately familiar with
what we do. It's not that I don't believe in us, in fact we
have big growth plans for the next 3 years and I am certain we'll meet
them. It's just that I find it incredibly difficult to describe to
others in a "elevator pitch" what a software consultancy can offer
without goign down the "technology" rabbit hole.

The exercise is: *if I were introduced to someone at a party how do I convince them they should 
hire DockYard*? Funny enough, I can't do it. This is a very large
deficiency for me/my company right now. To date **all** of our
contracts have been from inbound sales. Which is great, but we need to
be able to sell our services to companies that don't yet know about us.

So what does DockYard do? According to our current landing page *We
create web & mobile applications*. Which is 100% true, but if I told
this to you I doubt you'd hire us. Some of our clients get in touch with
us because of our expertise with Ember.js. At that point the sale is
actually quite easy. There aren't a lot of consultanices right now
claiming expertise in Ember. And amongst those firms I believe that
DockYard is considered one of the top ones. So by the time the client
contacts us they have probably already decided to go with us. This is
great but is paints us into a niche, but we're missing out on the other
99.99% of the opportunties that don't know about DockYard.

Here is something I probably shouldn't be admitting: I can't put
together a sales pitch for my own company.

It's not that I don't know what we do, I am intimately familiar with
what we do. It's not that I don't believe in us, in fact we
have big growth plans for the next 3 years and I am certain we'll meet
them. It's just that I find it incredibly difficult to describe to
others in an "elevator pitch" what a software consultancy can offer
without going down the "technology" rabbit hole.

The exercise is: *if I were introduced to someone at a party, how do I convince them they should 
hire DockYard*? Funny enough, I can't do it. This is a very large
deficiency for me/my company right now. To date **all** of our
contracts have been from inbound sales. Which is great, but we need to
be able to sell our services to companies that don't yet know about us.

So what does DockYard do? According to our current landing page *We
create web & mobile applications*. Which is 100% true, but if I told
this to you I doubt you'd hire us. I asked other DockYard'ers to try
their hand at writing the DY pitch. To illustrate how difficult this is
here is what they came up with:

* DockYard designs and develops applications for people who have an idea and don't know what to do next
* We build web products, and focus on quality.
* We're a design and development shop specializing in really intuitive, responsive user interfaces. We work primarily with Ember.js, which is a JavaScript framework similar to Angular and Backbone. On the backend, we prefer a Rails backend and transactional database, which is more reliable than the NoSQL databases out there.
* DockYard leads projects from ideas to user-friendly products that are built by cutting edge technologies and methodologies. As a team, we put clients' business goals in the forefront through the collaborative expertise of our designers and developers.
* DockYard helps business owners create web apps with the combined power of Ember and great design.
* We're a team of software designers and engineers deeply invested in producing the best solution to a challenge, rather than just the one that works.
* We do a lot of research before we start designing, so our projects are thought through. Designers have a lot of say in what we actually build, compared to other shops, so it makes the work more meaningful. (when telling other designers about my work. Sort of related to pitching because those people influence purchasing decisions in their area of expertise)

Some of these go beyond the scope of a "pitch" but I think the message is clear: this is not an easy assignment. 
The common theme is the focus on our expertise, which is a good angle. Expertise has been what defines DockYard.
But do all companies care about **how** we build? 

Currently nearly all of our clients get in touch with us because
of our expertise in Ember.js. At that point the sale is
actually quite easy. There aren't a lot of consultancies right now
claiming expertise in Ember. Amongst those firms I believe that
DockYard is considered one of the top. So by the time the client
contacts us they have probably already decided to go with us. This is
great but it paints us into a niche. We're missing out on the other
99.99% of the opportunities that don't know about us.

So how do some other software consultanices pitch? I don't know if it is
fair to use the marketing tagline from their website as their "pitch"
but I think it is close enough for the purposes of this article. Let's
take a look:

* **Thoughtworks** *We provide software delivery, pioneering tools and
  consulting for organizations with ambitious missions.*
* **Pivotal Labs** *We transform how the world builds software.*
* **thoughtbot** *Our clients hire us to design and build their
  products. We focus on user outcomes and simplicity. We write code for
iOS, Android, and the web.*
* **37signals** *an elite team of experts web design and usability
  specialists dedicated to simple, clear, and useable customer-focused
design.*

I don't know if this really helps me or confuses me even more. These are
all over the place, from general, to technology specific, to downright
vague. Each of these companies have been very successful. How much of
their success do they own to their sales pitches? **37signals** (when
they were a consultancy) was famous for being a referral based business.
(or at least advertising themselves as such) I don't know **thoughtbot**
as well as I used to but I believe they still don't have any internal
sales team. **Thoughtworks** and **Pivotal** both have sales/biz-dev
teams. Their marketing lines are very vague, very "wide-net". No help
here.

It's sad to say but I am currently at a loss on how to effectively sell my own company.

Today I am very proud to announce that the DockYard-led redesign of
[rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org) has been launched.

[Ruby Central](http://rubycentral.org) just announced and put into production a redesign of Ruby's
most popular community website during the Lightning Talk session at
[RubyConf 2014](http://rubyconf.org)

The redesign effort was led by [Logan
Faerber](https://twitter.com/LoganFaerber) and built out by [Amanda
Cheung](https://twitter.com/acacheung). You can see how happy it has
made them.

We would have been lost without the guidance from Ruby Central folks [Evan
Phoenix](https://twitter.com/evanphx),
[David Radcliffe](https://twitter.com/dwradcliffe), [Andr√© Arko](https://twitter.com/indirect). As well as some insight from [Nick Quaranto](http://twitter.com/qrush).

We were very fortunate to have been selected. We hope that everyone
enjoys the new look!
